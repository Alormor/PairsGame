# PAIRS GAME
Coding a JavaScript memory matching game or pairs game is another 
fun project you can build for fun (and for your portfolio!).

The logic of the game is simple:

There are a given number of cards on the table facing down. The player 
needs to find all the pairs. However, you may want to add more difficulty 
by limiting the number of guesses or by setting a time limit for the game 
to be finished.
